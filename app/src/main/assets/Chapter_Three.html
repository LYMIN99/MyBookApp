        <h3><strong>Will Ghana be like Nigeria?</strong></h3>
        <p>Nigeria, Ghana's close neighbour, went through a similarly slow legislative process before the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/FOI/Freedom%20Of%20Information%20Act.pdf" data-versionurl="http://web.archive.org/web/20190526172257/https://www.cbn.gov.ng/FOI/Freedom%20Of%20Information%20Act.pdf" data-versiondate="2019-05-26T17:22:58+00:00" data-amber-behavior="">Freedom of Information (FOI)</a>&nbsp;was signed into law in May 2011, by then-President Goodluck Jonathan.

        <p>While civil society and the press struggled to make government business more transparent and open, the government resisted these moves.</p>
        <p>Ayobami Ojebode, a professor of communication, wrote that the reasons behind the &ldquo;reluctance&rdquo; to pass the bill were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/4253994/Nigeria_s_freedom_of_information_act_Provisions_strengths_challenges">a manifestation of&nbsp;</a>&ldquo;the age-long struggle in Nigeria (and elsewhere) between the press, citizens and civil society on the one hand and the government on the other.&rdquo;</p>
