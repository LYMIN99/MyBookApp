        <p>I often speak about my grandfather (now about 92) who can read and write in Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; but not in English. He lived a successful life as a goldsmith, and lived in many parts of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>I think of him often when I think of the issues of inclusion in today&rsquo;s language technology. There are many times I go to his house and I have to help him operate his mobile phone, retrieve old messages, or respond to some phone commands.</p>
        <p>In his house and in my father&rsquo;s office, in the early nineties, is where I first saw rotary phones &mdash; so the problem isn&rsquo;t that he hasn&rsquo;t seen phones before, or used them to communicate. But mobile phones and their technical features pose new problems.</p>
